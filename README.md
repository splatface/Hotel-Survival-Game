This is a simple game written in python using the pygame library. It is a mini-project so there is no way to download or run it other than forking the project and running the main file yourself.

Premise:
The name of the game is Hotel 666. The MC is trapped in a hotel after an accident and must escape. 

Controls:
You can control the character using either the WASD or arrow keys. There are objects you can interact with; press the letter shown on the screen to interact. Some of theses are also explained in the game's help menu.

Thank you!
